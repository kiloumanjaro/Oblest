# Student Productivity & Focus App

This project aims to develop an application designed to help students combat procrastination, enhance focus, and improve academic performance through gamification and structured time management.

## About

Procrastination is a significant hurdle for students, often leading to decreased motivation and academic underperformance. Our app addresses this by providing a gamified platform that encourages focused study habits, tracks progress, and rewards achievements. By making the academic journey engaging and positive, we strive to help students overcome procrastination and achieve their academic goals.

## Background Information

Procrastination is a widespread issue affecting a large majority of students. Research indicates:

* **Prevalence:** 80-95% of students experience procrastination (Steel, 2007).
* **Negative Impacts:** Procrastination correlates with poor academic performance, increased stress, and mental health issues (Steel et al., 2001; Stead et al., 2010).
* **Online Learning Challenges:** The rise of online learning has further exacerbated procrastination tendencies (Yilmaz, 2017; Melgaard et al., 2022; Santelli et al., 2020).
* **Underlying Reasons:** Procrastination stems from various psychological and situational factors, including anxiety, perfectionism, and lack of resources (Steel, 2007).

Understanding these factors allows us to tailor our app to effectively address the specific needs of students struggling with procrastination.
